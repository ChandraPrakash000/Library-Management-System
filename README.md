### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT
    issued_emp_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN books as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
issued_status as ist
JOIN
books as b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1
```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';
```

10. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT 
    e1.emp_id,
    e1.emp_name,
    e1.position,
    e1.salary,
    b.*,
    e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as e1
JOIN 
branch as b
ON e1.branch_id = b.branch_id    
JOIN
employees as e2
ON e2.emp_id = b.manager_id
```

Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE expensive_books AS
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7.00;
```

Task 12: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;
```

## Advanced SQL Operations

**Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

```sql
SELECT 
    ist.issued_member_id,
    m.member_name,
    bk.book_title,
    ist.issued_date,
    -- rs.return_date,
    CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date as over_dues_days
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN 
members as m
    ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN 
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE 
    rs.return_date IS NULL
    AND
    (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date) > 30
ORDER BY 1
```


**Task 14: Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_reports
AS
SELECT 
    b.branch_id,
    b.manager_id,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as number_book_issued,
    COUNT(rs.return_id) as number_of_book_return,
    SUM(bk.rental_price) as total_revenue
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN 
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = bk.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;

SELECT * FROM branch_reports;
```

**Task 15: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql

CREATE TABLE active_members
AS
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE member_id IN (SELECT 
                        DISTINCT issued_member_id   
                    FROM issued_status
                    WHERE 
                        issued_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 month'
                    )
;

SELECT * FROM active_members;

```


**Task 16: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
SELECT 
    e.emp_name,
    b.*,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_book_issued
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

**Task 17: Create Table As Select (CTAS)**
Objective: Create a CTAS (Create Table As Select) query to identify overdue books and calculate fines.

Description: Write a CTAS query to create a new table that lists each member and the books they have issued but not returned within 30 days. The table should include:
    The number of overdue books.
    The total fines, with each day's fine calculated at $0.50.
    The number of books issued by each member.
    The resulting table should show:
    Member ID
    Number of overdue books
    Total fines
